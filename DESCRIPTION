Description: This package provides multi-omics and phenotypic data for 199 genotypes of 
 Populus trichocarpa, originating from various locations across Western Europe and grown 
 in a common garden experiment in Orléans, France.
 .
 The dataset includes:
 - A SNP matrix with 1,217,000 markers,
 - DNA methylation data in CG, CHG, and CHH sequence contexts,
 - Transcriptomic expression levels for 25,819 genes,
 - A data frame of 20 phenotypic traits related to growth, wood chemistry, and disease resistance.
 .
 This resource enables integrative analyses in statistical genomics, systems biology, 
 and quantitative trait mapping for forest tree research.
